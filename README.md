# Virtual Machine

**Project Completed on 09 April 2019**

This project provides a local/cloud server solution. This easy to use application can store your file on your local/cloud server and access them faster.

The program creates logical folder structures using trees, hence saving space on the server.

**How is this better?**

This provides an OS independant solution, i.e. The application can be used on any OS on the server side.

# Future Scope
1. To enable automatic OS detection.
2. To provide file encryption & decryption.
3. Enhance speed.
4. Graphical User Interface.
